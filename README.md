# Solo Transcriptions
Here I'll be adding my solo transcriptions. Most of them will be trombone solos since that's what I play, but not necessarily.

For writing them down I use [Lilypond](https://www.lilypond.org) and [Vim](https://www.vim.org) text editor. You can find the .ly files next to the compiled pdf. If there's only the pdf that means it's an old transcription from back when I used musescore. 

Feel free to use all the contents in this repository however you like. You're also welcome to submit your own transcriptions via a pull request.
